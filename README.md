MoodMate – Your Personal Mood Tracker (Python + SQL)

MoodMate is a lightweight and beginner-friendly mood tracking application I built using Python and MySQL/SQLite.
Its purpose is simple: let users log their mood each day, view trends, and understand how their emotions change over time.

I made this project to learn how apps collect, store, and visualize personal data, and how a basic digital wellness tool works behind the scenes.
